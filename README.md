# Group-Assignment-1
Imagine you are hired by retail giant Shoprite to design them some software for their daily operations. The company needs software that enables them to sell their products, keep track of stock, and receive some prompts from the system to reorder some new item if the stock runs low. Upon receiving new stock, the managers should be able to add new stock before selling begins. Shoprite also needs the same software to be able to manage their employees, particularly on the hours worked, which will later be used to calculate the salary depending on the job grade of the employee. The system should also track whether an employee is permanently employed or is on contract. Kindly use the marking rubric below to design software that Shoprite can use. (Note: Students are allowed to expand the scenario as long as it remains in the confinement of retail operations. Deliberations on the scenario can be done in the tutorial class or students can interview people working in retail to understand some daily operations involved.)
